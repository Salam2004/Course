Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.


Abdul Salam Shaik
Divide and Conquer
Breaking down a complex problem into smaller independent subproblems, solving each subproblem recursively, and combining their solutions to solve the original problem.
This approach improves efficiency by tackling easier parts first and merging results systematically.
